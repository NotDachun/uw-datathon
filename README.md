# uw-datathon
Project for UW Datathon 2018

Questions:
Is it always better to make a lower goal? (Ie: do lower goals actually correlate to higher success?)
Does average pledge correlate to goal? 

Is there a correlation between the goal of the project and its success? 
How can this data help individuals and startups that wish to launch their idea on Kickstarter?
Are there certain types of media more prone to success on the platform?
What is the forecast of new projects and funders by category for the upcoming year?

Analysis of which category is most popular/rich:
(aka what is the most popular and who is their demographic)
	Average pledge cost by category 
	Average total number of pledges by category

Launch date correlation to percentage of goal (median first ie: percentage pass fail)
(ie months)
